To generate a new build just run:

`npm run build`

Some comments:

- To export a new component, you need to add an import in src/components/index.ts and export it
- DonÂ´t forget to encapsulate the new component with ChakraProvider ThemeProvider and GlobalStyles (these 3 components, are responsibles for style)
